The main goal of this project is to create four robotic
systems that can carry a flag in hurdle area. The basic
working principle of these systems is to detect robots
and obstacles at a certain height with a camera located
out of the platform and to establish routes by color
selection. With the routes calculated, we will establish a
map for carrying the flag to another robot. The technical
process of the Project is mainly based on the Image
Processing, Embedded Systems, Robotics, artificial
Intelligence and Control Systems.
